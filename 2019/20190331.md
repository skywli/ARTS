## review
I read this article yesterday,whick is about someone  get  his first developer job at age 40 after 10 months of hard work,no develop experience ,full time.

what can I learn from this? As a people not any programing experience,he can learn  a skill ,full-time work. So it should be  very easy to learn  some new skills for programer because of many experiences. However I feel nothing and waste much time  year by year.It will be more and more worse if I don't  make some effort to change .

## tip
 I learned envoy and k8s,but I find it's very hard because of environment poor.Also it's a tool that is used for  deployment and management. Envoy is a proxy used to decouple application logic from network. It's written by c++,a good example studying.

 Cloud Native is a trend for back-end,it can help to increase software industry efficiency ignoring some performance,which can be gotten  by many machine.

## share
I will do some prcatise on purpose per week .  
There are some reasons for this:  
First,This can help me summarize what I had done and what I hadn't done ,it can promote me to understand myself and my potential.
Second,this is be userful for studying something because of writing,
More important,this can temper my willpower and improve self-cultivation.
Eventually,I will record  this with english at least one year although my english is poor.
